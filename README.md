# Impact-Analysis-of-GoodThought-NGO-Initiatives
This project analyzes the impact and effectiveness of Good Thought NGO's humanitarian initiatives through data-driven insights from their comprehensive PostgreSQL database spanning 2010 to 2023. Good Thought NGO catalyzes positive change globally, focusing on education, healthcare, and sustainable development to uplift underprivileged populations and foster long-term community growth. Using the GoodThought database containing three interconnected tables—assignments (project details, budgets, regions, impact scores), donations (funding records linked to donors and projects), and donors (funding organization information)—the project explores how financial resources are allocated, utilized, and translated into community impact. The analysis examines assignment performance by region, evaluates the relationship between funding and impact outcomes, identifies high-impact projects, and explores donor contribution patterns across different geographical areas. This practical application of SQL analytics demonstrates how data-driven approaches enhance humanitarian decision-making, optimize resource allocation, and measure the effectiveness of development initiatives.
